# Iota Pastes
Iota Pastes allows you to store up to 2600 characters on the tangle. They can be viewed as either plain text or markdown with built in XSS protection and optional encryption. Data can also be directly linked to, with and without xss protection. This means you could (temporarily) host a small single page website on the the Iota tangle.
